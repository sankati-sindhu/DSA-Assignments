1. Write a program to insert and delete an element at the nth and kth position in a linked list where n and k is taken from user. -->> insdel.c
2.Construct a new linked list by merging alternate nodes of two lists for example in list 1 we have {1,2,3} and in list 2 we have {4,5,6} in the new list we should have {1,4,2,5,3,6} -->> mergeAlt.c
3.Find all the elements in the Stack whose sum is equal to k(where k is given from user). -->> sumK.c
4.Write a program to print the elements in a queue
   i.in reverse order. 
   ii.in alternate order.
--> queueDis.c
5. ii. write a program to add the first element of one list to another list for example we have {1,2,3} in list 1 and {4,5,6} in list 2 we have to get {4,1,2,3} as output for list 1 and {5,6} for list 2. --> shif1LL.c
